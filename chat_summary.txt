User: hello
Bot: Hello! How can I help you today?

Based on our previous conversation, are you interested in learning more about Zluri, its features, or perhaps have questions about the competitor comparison we discussed? I can also provide information about our integrations, like the one with Slack, or direct you to resources like our blog, case studies, or community forum.

Just let me know what you'd like to explore.

User: yes
Bot: Yes, I can help you with that! Based on our previous conversation, would you like to proceed with learning more about Zluri and its features?

If you're interested, I can provide information about:

*   **Zluri's core features:** Comprehensive discovery, centralized management, security, spend optimization, integrations, reporting, and access management.
*   **Competitor comparison:** A table contrasting Zluri with SailPoint, Torii, Zylo, Productiv, Lumos, and Okta.
*   **Integrations:** Details on integrations like the one with Slack.
*   **Resources:** Links to our blog, case studies, or community forum.

Please let me know which of these topics you'd like to explore further, or if you have a different question in mind.

User: who is the owner of zluri?
Bot: Unfortunately, I am unable to provide you with specific information about the owner(s) of Zluri. The available documentation mentions "Zluri Inc." with copyright, payment owner, and IT owner information, but it does not specify who the owner(s) of Zluri are.

If you require more information about the ownership of Zluri, I would recommend the following:

*   **Consult Zluri's official website:** Look for an "About Us" or "Company Information" section, which may contain details about the company's founders or ownership structure.
*   **Contact Zluri directly:** Reach out to Zluri's sales or support team through their website to inquire about ownership information.
*   **Use business information resources:** Check business directories, databases, or financial information providers, which might contain details about Zluri's ownership.
User: give me contact of zluri
Bot: To contact Zluri, you have a few options:

*   **Email Support:** You can email their support team directly at support@zluri.com.
*   **Submit a Ticket:** You can submit a support ticket through their support page. Unfortunately, I don't have the direct link to their support page, but you can likely find it on their website.
*   **Chat, Mail or Phone:** To upgrade your plan, you can contact the Zluri team through chat, mail, or phone.
*   **Website:** You can find a link to their website in the content I have access to, however, I am unable to share it.

If you need to reach a specific department like sales, I recommend visiting their website to find the appropriate contact information.

User: give me link to submit the ticket
Bot: You can submit a ticket to Zluri using the following link: help.zluri.com. This link will take you to Zluri's new Help Center where you can find the "Submit a ticket" option.
